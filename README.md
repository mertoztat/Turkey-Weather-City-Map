## Notes: 

"This project was built using next13, tailwind CSS, OpenWeather API, Redux, Redux Toolkit, and Turkey React Map.

After cloning the project to your computer, you need to create a file named .env.local and fill it with the following:

NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL="https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/"
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY="You should enter the API key you obtained from OpenWeather here."

Once you've filled in these details, you can run the project by executing 'npm install' and 'npm run dev'."

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:
